# What is Peershares?
--------------------
Peershares is an inexpensive and decentralized ledger to be used by 
businesses for tracking share ownership and distributing dividends in an automated fashion. 
Shares can be transferred and held just like other cryptocurrency units, such as peercoins or bitcoins.

Using Peershares, individuals, businesses, or organizations of any size could raise 
funding through an initial offering without depending on a third party such as a stock exchange. 
While trading shares through exchanges will be useful to provide liquidity, 
Peershares can be traded on any number of exchanges just as Peercoins can.

Each business using Peershares will have their own blockchain that is independent of all others. 
Blockchains can be secured cheaply and easily using Peercoin's proof-of-stake, 
once the initial (issuer-controlled) shares has been generated using proof-of-work.
Issuers can distribute dividends as Peercoins, which can then be held by the investors, 
or if they would prefer, can then take those dividends and convert them to another cryptocurrency or fiat through their preferred exchange.

A share issuer is not vulnerable to the failure of single stock exchange such as BTC Trading or Litecoin Global.

# Setup
-----
Unpack the files into a directory and run your desired build:
 32/Peershares (GUI, 32-bit)
 32/Peershares-X.X.X-win-setup.exe (GUI installer, 32-bit)
 32/Peersharesd (command line, 32-bit)
 64/Peershares (GUI, 64-bit)
 64/Peershares-X.X.X-win-setup.exe (GUI installer, 64-bit)
 64/Peersharesd (command line, 64-bit)
 
The software automatically finds other nodes to connect to.  You can
enable Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) with your router/firewall
or forward port 9901 (TCP) to your computer so you can receive
incoming connections.  Peershares works without incoming connections,
but allowing incoming connections helps the Peershares network.
