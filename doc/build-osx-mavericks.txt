See readme-qt.rst for instructions on building PPCoin QT, the
graphical user interface.

These recipes have been tested on 10.9 Intel only.

Typographic conventions: all commands which should be executed in
the Terminal emulator of your choice (Terminal.app is very popular
and comes with OS/X) are in single quotes or are separated by
empty lines and indented by two characters.

So, for example 'this is a command' and

  so is this

Typographic conventions aside, let us move to the actual business of
building PPCoin.

1. Prerequisites

   You need Apple XCode, XCode command line tools and Homebrew (see
   <URL:http://brew.sh/>) to build PPCoin. Apple XCode and XCode command
   line tools are mandatory, but there are other options for Homebrew
   (namely Fink, <URL:http://www.finkproject.org/>, and MacPorts,
   <URL:https://www.macports.org/>). However, this document and the
   accompanied makefile.osx-mavericks will assume you're using Homebrew.
   It shouldn't be too hard for you to modify the Makefile, in case
   you don't feel like using Homebrew.

   Download and install Apple XCode 5 from Apps Store. For more information
   see <URL:https://developer.apple.com/xcode/>. You can also install
   it by running 'xcode-select --install'. 

   Install Homebrew from <URL:http://brew.sh/>. I recommend that you
   do this as a normal user and not root. If you want to use default
   location for Homebrew ("/usr/local"), just give your normal user
   account ownership of the destination directory by running
   'sudo chown <my_account_here> /usr/local'.

   Remember to run 'brew doctor' before moving forward.

2. Required programs and depency libraries

   These come from Homebrew:

     brew install berkeley-db4 boost boost-build git miniupnpc

3. Clone the Primecoin git repository

     git clone git@github.com:ppcoin/ppcoin.git ppcoin

4. Build 64-bit PPCoin daemon

     cd ppcoin/src && make -f makefile.osx-mavericks 64BIT=true

   Leave 64BIT=true out, if you want a 32-bit binary (unless you're
   absolutely sure, you probably don't).

5. Test the binary

   For a list of command line options, run:

     src/ppcoind --help

   To start the PPCoin daemon, run:
 
     src/ppcoind -daemon

   If you've enabled RPC, to get a list of RPC commands, run:

     src/ppcoind help

   The last one is actually far out from the scope of this document
   and most likely fails. Consult help and search engines to find out
   how to make best use of PPCoin daemon RPC.
