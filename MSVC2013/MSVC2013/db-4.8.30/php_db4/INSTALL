This php module can be configured and built to run standalone
or in the context of the mod_db4 Apache module (Apache 1.3.* only).
These configurations are not interchangeable.

*** A note about pthreads ***
The db4 c++ library by default tries to link against libpthread on some
systems (notably Linux).  If your PHP install is not linked against
libpthread, you will need to disable pthread support in db4.  This can
be done by compiling db4 with the flag  --with-mutex=x86/gcc-assembly.
PHP can itself be forced to link against libpthread either by manually
editing
its build files (which some distributions do), or by building it with
--with-experimental-zts.

To install this php module linked against the mod_db4 framework,
execute the following steps:

> phpize
> ./configure --with-db4[=/path/to/db4]
--with-mod_db4=$APACHE_INCLUDEDIR
> make
> su -
# make install

Then in your php.ini file add:

extension=db4.so

This extension will now ONLY run in a SAPI linked into Apache httpd
(mod_php4, most likely), and will take advantage of all of it's 
auto-recovery and handle-caching facilities.


To install this php module linked against db-4.2 and NOT the mod_db4
framework,
execute the following steps:

> phpize
> ./configure --with-db4[=/path/to/db4]
> make
> su -
# make install

Then in your php.ini file add:

extension=db4.so
