        The easiest way to add replication to your transactional
        application is to use the Replication Manager. The Replication Manager provides a comprehensive 
        communications layer that enables replication. For a brief listing
        of the Replication Manager's feature set, see 
        <a class="xref" href="apioverview.html#repframeworkoverview" title="Replication Manager Overview">Replication Manager Overview</a>.
    </p>
      <p>
        To use the Replication Manager, you make use of special methods off the
        <span><code class="classname">DB_ENV</code> class.</span>
        
        That is: 
    </p>
      <div class="orderedlist">
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            <p>
                                    Create an environment handle as normal.
                            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                                    Configure your environment handle as
                                    needed (e.g. set the error file and
                                    error prefix values, if desired).
                            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                                    Use the Replication Manager replication methods to
                                    configure the Replication Manager. Using these
                                    methods causes DB to know that you
                                    are using the Replication Manager.
                            </p>
            <p>
                                    Configuring the Replication Manager entails setting the replication
                                    environment's priority, setting the TCP/IP address
                                    that this replication environment will use for
                                    incoming replication messages, identifying
                                    TCP/IP addresses of other replication
                                    environments, setting the number of
                                    replication environments in the
                                    replication group, and so forth. These actions are
                                    discussed throughout the remainder of
                                    this chapter.

                                    Open your environment handle. When you
                                    do this, be sure to specify 

                                    <span><code class="literal">DB_INIT_REP</code> and
                                    <code class="literal">DB_THREAD</code> to your
                                    open flags. (This is in addition to the
                                    flags that you normally use for a
                                    single-threaded transactional
                                    application).  The first of these causes
                                    replication to be initialized for the
                                    application. The second causes your
                                    environment handle to be free-threaded
                                    (thread safe). Both flags are required
                                    for Replication Manager usage.

                                    must open their databases for read
                                    and write activity. Replicas can open
                                    their databases for read-only activity, but
                                    doing so means they must re-open the
                                    databases if the replica ever becomes a
                                    master.  Either way, replicas should never attempt to
                                    write to the database(s) directly.

                            The Replication Manager allows you to only use one

                                    Close your environment. This causes
                                    replication to stop as well.

                            Before you can use the Replication Manager, you may have to
                            enable it in your DB library. This is
                            <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> a requirement for
                            Microsoft Windows systems, or Unix systems that
                            use pthread mutexes by default. Other systems,
                            notably BSD and BSD-derived systems (such as
                            Mac OS X), must enable the Replication Manager when you
                            configure the DB build.
                    </p>
        <p>
                            You do this by <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
                            disabling replication and by configuring the
                            library with POSIX threads support. In other
                            words, replication must be turned on in the
                            build (it is by default), and POSIX thread
                            support must be enabled if it is not already by
                            default.  To do this, use the
                            <code class="literal">--enable-pthread_api</code> switch
                            on the configure script.

        <p>
                    As described above, you introduce replication to an
                    application by starting with a transactional
                    application, performing some basic replication
                    configuration, and then starting replication using 
                    <span><code class="methodname">DB_ENV-&gt;repmgr_start()</code>.</span>
                    
                    
            </p>
        <p>
                    You stop replication by closing your environment
                    cleanly in the same way you would for any DB application.
            </p>
        <p>
                For example, the following code fragment initializes, then
                stops and starts replication. Note that other replication
                activities are omitted for brevity.

                   The application starts up and declares the environment to be a master
                   without calling for an election. It is an error for more
                   than one environment to start up using this flag, or for
                   an environment
                   to use this flag when a master already exists.

                   <p>

                   <p>
                           In the event that a environment attempts to become a
                           master when a master already exists, the
                           replication code will resolve the problem by
                           holding an election. Note, however, that there
                           is always a possibility of data loss in the face
                           of duplicate masters, because once a master is
                           selected, the environment that loses the election will
                           have to roll back any transactions committed
                           until it is in sync with the "real" master.

                                    That is, the thread that called, for
                                    example,

                                    Note that if this write activity would
                                    cause the thread to be blocked due to
                                    some condition on the socket, the Replication Manager
                                    will hand the outgoing message to the

                                    then write the message to the socket.
                                    This prevents your database write
                                    threads from blocking due to abnormal

                                    messages. Typically, a response will
                                    include write activity to your
                                    database(s), so these threads can be
                                    busy performing disk I/O.

                    Of these threads, the only ones that you have any
                    configuration control over are the message processing
                    threads. In this case, you can determine how many
                    of these threads you want to run.

                    It is always a bit of an art to decide on a thread count,
                    but the short answer is you probably do not need more
                    than three threads here, and it is likely that one will
                    suffice. That said, the best thing to do is set your
                    thread count to a fairly low number and then increase
                    it if it appears that your application will benefit
                    from the additional threads.
