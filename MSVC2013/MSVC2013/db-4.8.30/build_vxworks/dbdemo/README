This README describes the steps needed to run a demo example of BerkeleyDB.

1. Read the pages in the Reference Guide that describe building
   BerkeleyDB on VxWorks:

	$(WIND_BASE)/target/src/BerkeleyDB/docs/ref/build_vxworks/intro.html
	$(WIND_BASE)/target/src/BerkeleyDB/docs/ref/build_vxworks/notes.html
	$(WIND_BASE)/target/src/BerkeleyDB/docs/ref/build_vxworks/faq.html

2. Launch Tornado 2.0 and open up the BerkeleyDB project.

3. Add the demo project to that workspace:

	$(WIND_BASE)/target/src/BerkeleyDB/build_vxworks/demo/dbdemo.wpj

4. Build BerkeleyDB as described in the Reference Guide.

5. Build the dbdemo project.

6. Download BerkeleyDB onto the target.

7. Download the dbdemo project onto the target.

8. Open a windsh to the target and run the demo:

	-> dbdemo "<pathname>/<dbname>"

   Where pathname is a pathname string pointing to a directory that the
   demo can create a database in.  That directory should already exist.
   The dbname is the name for the database.  For example:

	-> dbdemo "/tmp/demo.db"

9. The demo program will ask for input.  You can type in any string.
   The program will add an entry to the database with that string as
   the key and the reverse of that string as the data item for that key.
   It will continue asking for input until you hit ^D or enter "quit".
   Upon doing so, the demo program will display all the keys you have
   entered as input and their data items.
