This directory contains unit tests for the Java APIs that are common the BDB
and BDB JE products:  the bind, collections, persist (DPL) and util packages.

These tests are run using Apache Ant and JUnit.

External software requirements:

    Java 1.5 or later.
    The Sun JDK is normally used, but any compatible JVM should work.

    Apache Ant 7.0 or later.
    http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi

    JUnit 3.8.1 or 3.8.2 (later versions do not currently work)
    http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/junit/junit3.8.1.zip?download

The bin directories of both Java and Ant must be in your executable path.  The
junit.jar file must be available to Ant. The simplest way to do this is to copy
the junit.jar file into your Ant's lib directory.

There are two configuration settings for specifying the DB release to be
tested:

    The release binaries must be in your system library path (LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    on Unix).

    The Java property db.jar is specified to override the default location,
    which is the build_unix/db.jar file in this release directory.

The following ant commands should be executed from this directory:

    # To perform a clean build of the tests
    ant clean build 

    # To build (if needed) and run the tests
    ant test

    # To test the examples
    ant examples

For example, here are commands to build and test in a local db directory.

    cd ~/db/test/scr024
    ant clean build
    ant test

Several output directories are creating when building and testing.  These can
be deleted with:

    ant clean
