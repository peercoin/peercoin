Setting up a Gitian build environment
=====================================

You need the right hardware: you need a 64-bit-capable CPU with hardware virtualization support (Intel VT-x or AMD-V). Not all modern CPUs support hardware virtualization.

You probably need to enable hardware virtualization in your machine's BIOS.

You need to be running a recent version of 64-bit-Ubuntu, and you need to install several prerequisites:
  sudo apt-get install apache2 git apt-cacher-ng python-vm-builder qemu-kvm ruby

Sanity checks:
  sudo service apt-cacher-ng status   # Should return apt-cacher-ng is running
  ls -l /dev/kvm   # Should show a /dev/kvm device

Once you've got the right hardware and software:

    git clone git://github.com/peershares/peershares.git
    git clone git://github.com/devrandom/gitian-builder.git
    mkdir gitian-builder/inputs

    cd gitian-builder
    bin/make-base-vm --suite precise --arch i386
    bin/make-base-vm --suite precise --arch amd64
    cd ..

To build the software:
If you don't have the dependencies yet, get them and copy them to the inputs directory:
    wget 'http://miniupnp.tuxfamily.org/files/download.php?file=miniupnpc-1.9.tar.gz' -O gitian-builder/inputs/miniupnpc-1.9.tar.gz
    ...
See doc/release-process.txt for the complete list of dependencies.

    cd peershares
    git pull
    cd ../gitian-builder
    git pull
    ./bin/gbuild --commit peershares=HEAD ../bitcoin/contrib/gitian.yml

If you get a permission issue when you try to use gbuild:
    sudo adduser <your username> kvm
Then log out, log in and retry
