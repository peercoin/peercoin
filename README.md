### What is Peercoin?
[Peercoin](http://peercoin.net/) (abbreviated PPC), also known as PPcoin and Peer-to-Peer Coin is the first known [cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) designed as a combined [proof-of-stake](http://peercoin.net/peercoin-paper.pdf)/[proof-of-work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system) system. Peercoin is build upon [Bitcoin](http://bitcoin.org/en/), but unique in the fact that it is more energy efficiency, as proof-of-stake blocks require minimal energy consumption. Thus, with Peercoin energy consumption would decrease over time as proof-of-work blocks become less rewarding and coin generation becomes increasingly based on proof-of-stake block generation.

Repo Guidelines
================================

* Developers work in their own forks, then submit pull requests when they think their feature or bug fix is ready.
* If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the development team members simply pulls it.
* If it is a more complicated or potentially controversial change, then the change may be discussed in the pull request, or the requester may be asked to start a discussion [Peercoin Talk](http://www.peercointalk.org/) for a broader community discussion. 
* The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing. Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if they don't match the project's coding conventions (see coding.txt) or are controversial.
* From time to time a pull request will become outdated. If this occurs, and the pull is no longer automatically mergeable; a comment on the pull will be used to issue a warning of closure.  Pull requests closed in this manner will have their corresponding issue labeled 'stagnant'.
* For development ideas and help see [here](hhttp://www.peercointalk.org/index.php?board=10.0).
